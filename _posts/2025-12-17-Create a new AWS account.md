This is the first post on my AWS pentesting journey. I'll be documenting the AWS labs I create in this blog. If you ever have quetions on my posts, feel free to reach out to me on my X. 

Go to the following registration link for "Sign Up for AWS" and type in an email address and an account name you want to you use for you AWS account. 
https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register

Then verify your account.  If the email address and account names are valid, you will be sent a verification code to your email addresss. Once you have verified your email address, you will be taken to the next page for creating the account's password.

After you have created you password, you will be prompted a page to choose what kind of account plan you are looking for. There are two plans: Free (6 months) and Paid. 

The majority of the labs I will be creating in this journey can be replicated with an AWS free plan accuont, so go with the Free plan. For privacy reasons, I will not be showing the information I typed for the account.

I ended up going with the Paid plan because the information I provided for the Free plan were associated with my previous registered AWS account. If you are brand new or you are using new information to create your AWS account, you should be fine with the Free (6 months) plan.

Once you have done the registration, you will be welcomed with the Congratulations page.
