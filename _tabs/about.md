My name is Mana, but I go by the name ThorMM in games and across social media. I have several years of experience in the offensive side of cybersecurity and a deep fascination with both red and blue team disciplines. This blog serves as a space where I document topics that spark my curiosity and push me to dig deeper into areas I want to understand more thoroughly.  I hope you learn something new when you read my articles.
